## Contribution
You could contribute an episode of an existing collection. 
Or, you could create a new collection as well.

### Add new episode
Find the target directory under [podcasts](podcasts). Then add a YAML file in it. 
Below is a sample YAML file:

```yaml
title: The episode title
index: 1
description: The episode description
filename: "The URL of target audio file"
localStorage: url # keep this be same
```

### Create new collection
You need to add more files if you want to create a new collection.

First, please create a new directory under [podcasts](podcasts).

then, add a YAML file named `show.yaml`:
```yaml
title: The podcasts title
description: The podcasts description
image: "The logo of this podcasts"
link: https://linuxsuren.github.io/awesome-feeds
categories:
- Technology
localStorage: url
```

Finally, please add the following action into [generator.yaml](.github/workflows/generator.yaml) to generate RSS file automatically.
```yaml
      - name: Generate RSS for remote jobs
        uses: opensource-f2f/open-podcasts@master
        with:
          output: podcasts/remote-jobs/index.rss
          showFile: podcasts/remote-jobs/show.yaml
          itemsPattern: podcasts/remote-jobs/item-*.yaml
          server: "fake"
```
